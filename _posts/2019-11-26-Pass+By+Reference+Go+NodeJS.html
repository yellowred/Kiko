<p class="lead">
  Knowing how change of a function arguments affect the data outside of the function scope is essential in any programming 
  language. Unfortunately there is a lot of confusion in how arguments are passed to a function even in so well documented 
  languages like Java or Go, let alone NodeJS.

There are 3 types of passing variables to a function:
- pass by value,
- pass by pointer (pass by address),
- pass by reference.



### Pass By Value
This is means the variable will be cloned and the result will be passed to the function. Modification of the result will not affect 
the initial variable, so the function can change it's arguments without affecting data outside the function scope.

Golang supports it by default. However there is a confusion that slices and maps are passed by pointer. They are structures with 
a property that points to data. If code inside a function modifies the data, than the change will persist outside the function scope.
But it is not possible to assing a new struct to these arguments, i.e. change slice size.

<u>NodeJS pass all the arguments by value</u>. However when the argument is not a primitive, it stores pointers to it's internal 
properties and changes of those properties will affect data outside the function scope.

### Pass By Pointer
Sometimes also called pass by address. The function will receive a pointer value that is address in memory where the data is stored. 
Changing the argument inside the function will not affect the initial variable, but change of the value,
to which that argument points, will be visible outside the function scope.

Golang supports it if a symbol `*` added before type in function signature. Symbol `&` is used to get the address in memory of a 
variable and so the function can affect data outside it's scope.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	a := map[string]string{"fruit": "orange"}
	b := map[string]string{"fruit": "grapes"}
	fmt.Println(a, b)
	swap(&a, &b)
	fmt.Println(a, b)
}

func swap(a, b *map[string]string) {
	t := *a
	*a = *b
	*b = t
}
```

### Pass By Reference
The function will receive the same variable as argument so that the argument becomes an alias to initial variable. 
Therefore changing the argument directly affects the variable outside the function scope. There is a simple test for if this type 
of passing variable to a function is allowed in a programming language: swap function. If it is possible to write a function that 
swaps two variables that are passed to it, then pass by reference is allowed.
```c
void swapnum(int &i, int &j) {
  int temp = i;
  i = j;
  j = temp;
}
```

Neither Golang nor NodeJS support this and it is deemed unsafe technique to use.
